## About Resolver-Engine
[Resolver-Engine](https://github.com/Crypto-Punkers/resolver-engine) project is an [Ethereum Foundation grantee](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/), with a goal to create tooling for standardised Solidity import resolution.

In the past each and every framework has a different way of resolving imports, causing great anguish for the end-developers. With the Resolver-Engine, all projects that use it have a common set of supported functionality, sane defaults and maintenance of a dedicated team meaning that in the future Waffle will be able to support more imports just by upgrading the dependency.
